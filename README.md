# Fitbit-Data-Analysis

## Project Background
In this project, I will analyze my Fitbit data generated from my various daily activities.

I came up with this project idea when I realized that sometimes I feel energized, well-rested, and ready to start a new day when I wake up in the morning (Happy Morning), but other times, I feel still tired and am concerned about my future, and I just want to go back to sleep (Sad Morning).

I would rather have more "Happy Morning"s than "Sad Morning"s, so I became curious and started wondering what it is that's causing this difference.

Luckily, I have a Fitbit Charge 5 that I bought long time ago and haven't being wearing recently to keep track of various data about myself, so I decided to utilize it to answer my question.

In addition to the Fitbit data, I am planning to collect some other data such as:
- Data collected from my personal questionnaire which I answer every day on topics such as "How motivated are you now?", "Did you exercise today?", "Did you eat breakfast" etc..
- Weather data from where I live
- My personal Youtube/Instagram/Facebook usage
- etc..

Withe these data, I'll build a data pipeline and data warehouse and create some visualizations to understand what is causing a "Happy Morning" and what is causing a "Sad Morning".

As I'm still in the learning phrase and aspiring to be a data engineer, even if it's unnecesary, I will try to explore and use as many tools as I can afford. I will also keep track of my progress and difficulties I face along the way.
