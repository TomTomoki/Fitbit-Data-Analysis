# Fitbit-Data-Analysis
In this project, I will analyze my personal Fitbit data generated from my various daily activities.

In addition to the Fitbit data, I am planning to find and collect some other data, build a data pipeline and data warehouse, and create some visualizations. 

Examples of the additional source data include:
- Personal Questionnaire which I answer every day on topics such as "How motivated are you now?", "How did you wake up?", "Did you exercise for more than 30min today?", etc..
- Weather data
- My personal Youtube/Instagram/Facebook usage
